# Drosophila Whole Brain Fitting

This project implements a two-stage neural network model to simulate and predict the dynamics of the Drosophila (fruit fly) brain activity.

## Overview

The model consists of:

1. A spiking neural network that simulates the Drosophila brain's neuronal activity
2. A recurrent neural network (RNN) for encoding input signals and decoding neural activity

The implementation uses JAX for accelerated computation and follows a two-round training process.


## Data

This project requires two main datasets:

- connectome data from the FlyWire project (version 630/783): https://codex.flywire.ai/
- neural activity recordings from the Drosophila brain: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13349282


We have also provided preprocessed data files in the `data/` directory for convenience.

Please download the datasets (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TPuHJ-IC1yQtL5TMngAjGJa_JAMdusnu/view?usp=drive_link) and place them in the appropriate directories (`data/`) as specified in the code.



## Key Features

- Loads and processes Drosophila brain connectome data
- Simulates neural activity with biologically plausible dynamics
- Predicts firing rates across brain regions (neuropils)
- Evaluates prediction accuracy using bin classification and MSE metrics
- Visualizes simulated vs. experimental neural activity

## Usage

Run the training and prediction pipeline:

```bash
python drosophila_whole_brain_fitting.py --flywire_version 630 --neural_activity_id 2017-10-30_1 --devices 0 --split 0.6 --epoch_round1 50 --epoch_round2 50
```

### Command Line Arguments

- `--flywire_version`: Version of the FlyWire connectome data
- `--neural_activity_id`: ID of the neural activity recording dataset
- `--bin_size`: Size of bins for discretizing firing rates
- `--devices`: GPU device ID to use
- `--split`: Train/test split ratio
- `--epoch_round1`: Number of epochs for first-round training
- `--epoch_round2`: Number of epochs for second-round training


The model follows a two-round training approach:

1. **First Round**: Trains the spiking neural network to capture brain dynamics
2. **Second Round**: Trains the RNN encoder/decoder to process input signals

## Evaluation

The model evaluates performance using:
- Bin accuracy: Percentage of correctly predicted firing rate bins
- MSE loss: Mean squared error between predicted and actual firing rates

## Visualization

The model generates visualizations comparing:
- Simulated neuropil firing rates
- Experimental neuropil firing rates

Figures are saved in the output directory.
